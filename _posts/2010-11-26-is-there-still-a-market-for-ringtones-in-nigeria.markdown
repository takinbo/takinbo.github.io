I don't see those ads again; on TV or radio - advertising ringtone downloads and all that. I tried to figure it out. If the venture was profitable, what happened to the industry?

I think it's not that hard to figure out. First off, I think the pricing of ringtones didn't adapt quickly to the changes in the market. I'm pretty sure 99% if not 99.999% of all truetones on mobile phones these days are essentially ripped mp3s. Mobile phone users have gotten smart enough to transfer ringtones from whatever source to their mobile phones. That's not going to change. So the question is, is there still a market for ringtones? My subjective answer is yes.

How? The current view about ringtones in the market needs to change. Ringtones are not the same as full-length music tracks and should not be treated as such. How many ringtones made out of full-length music tracks do you actually get to hear up until the end of the track? At best, you get to hear the first 30 seconds of the track and the most enjoyable parts of the music track do not usually start at the beginning.

My take on ringtones is that they shouldn't be sold or if they must, then it should be at an afforable price. â‚¦100 per ringtone doesn't come across to me as affordable for a majority of mobile phone users. Ringtones could potentially, be used to create awareness or even drive sales for full-length music tracks or albums.

I'm left wondering how the ringtone market is fairing in other parts of the world? What sort of challenges are they facing?
