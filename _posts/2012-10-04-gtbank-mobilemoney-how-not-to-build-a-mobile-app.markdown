[Dipo](http://tnt64.blogspot.com) just hinted me about [GTB's Mobile Money](http://www.gtbank.com/services/e-channels/mobilemoney.html) service. Initially I thought: "Isn't it the same thing as the MTN Mobile Money service?" It turned out that this is an entirely different service. I'm not going to even go in the direction of wondering why they were creating a parallel mobile money service.

I was pleased to see this wasn't a USSD or SMS-based service and grabbed the app for Android as published on the same service description page.

My first thoughts, "nice looking app". The registration process was quick and painless. I was activated and was using the app in no time. Until things started going south. First, I started wondering, how do I get money onto this service? There are no instructions on how to do that. I even remembered seeing GTB Mobile Money on Quickteller and tried using that option and I kept getting the error:


> [70013]: Unrecognised customer information supplied: Service: GTMobileMoney, Wallet number (080XXX): 080********


For me that's a catastrophic fail! How do you release a product to the market that doesn't work? That's not the end of it. Then I tried some of the options on the screen. Airtime doesn't work, Bills Payment doesn't work, Mobile Banking doesn't work; why are they even on that screen? All you need to put there are the features that work. It's totally unprofessional for a user to click on a feature and get: "Feature not yet available. Will be available soon." What does that mean? I'll rather that I know that all I can do is Send Money and pay merchants. This isn't the way you build a mobile app.
