[![](http://blog.timakinbo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/L1030067-300x168.jpg)](http://blog.timakinbo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/L1030067.jpg)I realize there's been a lot of excite about [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) on [several](http://www.hnsearch.com/search#request/all&q=raspberry+pi) [geek](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/jan/09/raspberry-pi-computer-revolutionise-computing-schools) [channels](http://www.geek.com/articles/chips/raspberry-pi-makes-the-sub-100-pc-a-reality-20120112/) on the web. I didn't realize until I decided to check it out and now I just can't contain my excitement.

According to the Raspberry Pi FAQ:


> The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized computer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. It’s a capable little PC which can be used for many of the things your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word-processing and games. It also plays high-definition video. We want to see it being used by kids all over the world to learn programming.


What's amazing about the Raspberry Pi is that you get a fully-functional computer (excluding input and output devices) for ₦4000 ($25). What more is that the computer can be plugged directly into a TV and with any cheap USB keyboard, you have a fully functioning computer. Even though I don't see this really appealing to folks that can afford high-end widescreen laptops, this reduces the barrier of entry for those who can't afford expensive laptops/desktops and sorry it wouldn't run Windows.

I think we are looking at technology that will finally include those who have been formerly excluded from the digital age. Raspberry Pi is still just an onboard computer and at a stage where entrepreneurs can package it properly into devices that are more useful.
