A couples of months back, [we](http://www.timbaobjects.com/) switched from using [Swift Networks](http://www.swiftng.com/) to [Mobitel](http://campaign.mobitel.com.ng/) for our Internet access and that decision was made mainly because of poor service coverage at our office. The first few days were great! Even though we didn't have excellent signal, the service was usable. During week days, we never got speeds that were advertised. We had initially subscribed for their 3Mbps bundle but when we realized we weren't getting anywhere near those speeds, we decided to go for the 2Mbps bundle. That took over 24 hours to effect. We lost a day of productivity.

In the ensuing months, service degraded drastically and we experienced serious network outages. There were several complaints and after about two weeks, they eventually pinpointed the problem to be a cut fibre cable. Service got restored after a few days.

What had always been an issue for me with Mobitel, was the fact that there was no quick and easy way to pay for subscription and get activated not to even mention the quite incompetent engineers they seem to have hired (that's a story for another day); when an ISP has a policy that you cannot change settings like your SSID or password on your modem, then that should give you some concern. Anyways, I was really excited when I read the announcement of the provision of a [quickteller](http://quickteller.com/) option for payments. Awesome! I thought, this should be quick and painless. It's over 24 hours now and we're yet to receive activation. All the customer service reps keep telling us is that they're experiencing some "downtime" and they'll work on it ASAP and all that.

Now I keep asking myself if we did the right thing to have switched providers.
