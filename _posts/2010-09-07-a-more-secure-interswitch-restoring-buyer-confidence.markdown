[![](/public/uploads/2010/09/4600003516_b7613f8b82.jpg)](/public/uploads/2010/09/4600003516_b7613f8b82.jpg)Ask any regular John on the street why they don't buy things online and I bet you the odds are that 7 out of 8 (who know you can do that online) will tell you they don't trust 'the site' that's why they don't buy online.

Anyone who understands how the Insterswitch Webpay system works will find that puzzling as you don't have to 'trust' a merchant to buy from them. The only risk you're exposed to (if of course the merchant isn't a phishing site) is paying and not getting service or the product you paid for. Inspiring customer trust is a responsibility the merchant ought to take however, today's post isn't focussed on the merchant but on what Interswitch needs to do to reinvigorate the e-commerce industry in Nigeria.

There are three things Interswitch (in co-operation with the banks) needs to start doing today:


### Chargebacks


Chargebacks are protection for card holders. What this means is that if you see a charge on your card for something you suspect to be a fraudulent transaction, you can make a request through your bank and if your claims are verified, the transaction will be reversed. This action (usually) penalizes the merchants and so puts them on high alert to authenticate transactions and only charge when they're sure the transaction is done with the card holder's authorization.


### Authentication Transactions


How do you know that a transaction is authentic? That's really hard to do on the Internet but not impossible. One way this can be accomplished is by making a secret charge on the card and requesting the customer to supply the amount that was charged to the card. This step requires the customer to also have access to the card holders bank records which are usually statements which are gotten via email, sms, online bank statement or directly from the bank. Once this information has been gotten, the customer can then authenticate themselves as the real owner of the card. The likelihood that a phisher has access to both card details and bank statement records (either via access to the customer's phone or email) are slim and so this method is suitable for authenticating customers.

This can be cumbersome if this authentication is done for every transaction so it's essentially used to authenticate cards that are used on a customer's account for the first time.

The amount charged for this method of authentication ought to be reversible and that takes us to the last feature:


### Reversible Transactions


What does a merchant do if they realize a transaction is fraudulent? They should be capable of reversing the transaction. This is currently not available on the Interswitch Webpay platform and should be. It reduces the likelihood of a chargeback for a fraudulent transaction and will cost the merchant a lot less.

Given the availability of chargebacks, authentication transactions and reversible transactions, customer confidence for doing business online would receive a significant boost.
