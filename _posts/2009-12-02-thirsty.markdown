I read something really thought provoking on [Seth Godin's blog](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/11/thirsty.html) today and I thought it necessary to reblog it.

I've noticed that people who read a lot of blogs and a lot of books also tend to be intellectually curious, thirsty for knowledge, quicker to adopt new ideas and more likely to do important work.

I wonder which comes first, the curiosity or the success?
