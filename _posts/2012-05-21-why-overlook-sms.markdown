If I asked you to build an application for Africans, that if it goes viral, can get 1 to 10 million users in a week, what platform will you choose?

There's been a lot of discussion amongst the African tech elite about replicating an Instagram-style success in Africa. I think the platform that has the potential for this scale of success is SMS. Africa doesn't have the web culture, necessary for the large kind of traction startups like Instagram enjoy in the West - just yet. She will, but not yet. In the mean time SMS is being over looked as "low tech" yet millions of text messages are sent and received throughout Africa on a daily basis.

It's high time developers stopped ignoring this platform and started innovating using it.
