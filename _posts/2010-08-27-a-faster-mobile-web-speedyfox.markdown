I'm obsessed with making the mobile web as fast as it can be - why? Because [people hate slow-loading web sites](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/response-times.html). With a lot of people getting online via mobile devices, it's imperative that web developers understand these issues and create web sites and applications that load quickly.

One other issue of major concern (especially for the mobile web) is data transfer. For users who pay for every kilobyte of data they download, having minimal data transfer can go a long way in improving user satisfaction - enter SpeedyFox.

SpeedyFox is an experimental service created at TimbaObjects to enhance the mobile web by making it faster and cheaper to access. SpeedyFox is a proxy server designed to cache and compress web traffic to make the web cheaper and faster for mobile devices. With SpeedyFox, you can see your pay as you go costs go down to about a quarter of your current costs.

It's open to the public now and we invite you to try the service. You can do so right away by configuring your mobile phone to use the following proxy settings.

Server: proxy.speedyfox.info
Port: 5050

You would need to login to use it. There's a limited demo account for trial:

Username: user1 (that's user with a number 1 at the end)
Password: 2233

To request your free account, visit [http://bit.ly/bDl2iX](http://bit.ly/bDl2iX) and fill out the form.

After trying the service out, let's have your comments.
