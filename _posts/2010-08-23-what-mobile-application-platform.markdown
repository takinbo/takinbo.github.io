In conversations with other developers, I often hear all sorts with regards to what platforms to develop mobile applications for in Nigeria.

I've always advocated development for the Nokia (Symbian) and BlackBerry platforms (if you are targeting feature phones, J2ME is your best bet). Now I have proof:

According to [this Google trends report](http://trends.google.com/trends?q=Nokia,+blackberry,+iphone,+android&ctab=0&geo=ng&date=all&sort=0), Nokia (Symbian) and the BlackBerry platforms are the two most popular platforms in Nigeria. So if you're a developer interested in developing applications for the Nigerian mobile device market, you should be looking at these two platforms.
