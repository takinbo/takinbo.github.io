It's simple - visibility.

Loy Okezie recently published a [blog post](http://www.startupsnigeria.com/2009/03/100-best-web-developers-from-nigeria/) listing a few of what he thinks to be the top 100 web developers in Nigeria. I found the comments to be very educative and interesting.

I happen to know virtually everyone on that list and while some comments [on the site](http://www.startupsnigeria.com/2009/03/100-best-web-developers-from-nigeria/#comments) and [elsewhere](http://www.nairaland.com/nigeria/topic-246291.0.html) were such that the author was partial, there's something very important here that I wish every other developer (that was nominated) will do something about - Get visible. The people on that list were there because Loy happened to know about them. Loy hasn't met a number of them physically but using online interaction tools and social networks, he's been able to get to know them.

After reading the comments on the blog and the discussion forum, I was happy to know that there are people making a difference all over Nigeria but they need to get visible and let the whole world know what they're doing. At the very least, I expect these web developers to have a [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) account (since I refer to it as a blog for lazy bloggers) and better still a blog. If they are very ambitious, they can go ahead to have a proper web site with profiles of what they've done, a blog and so on.
