I read [this post](http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/28/women-in-tech-stop-blaming-me/) at Techcrunch this morning and I didn't fail to recognize that this is actually a global phenomenon and I couldn't help asking myself: is entrepreneurship and technology a male thing?
<!-- more -->

I see this at play when I attend hackfests, tech meetups and Barcamps. The population of males in relation to females is staggering. In the Techcrunch post is this quote:


> ...women [stink] as entrepreneurs a lot of the time because they are nurturing and not risk-taking enough by nature. She also said when men roll the dice and take risks, that society doesn’t punish them at all, and it’s in their nature to take stupid risks.


Interesting enough, I've worked with women entrepreneurs and my opinion is that they have a higher tendency to be successful as entrepreneurs:

1. They are more trust inspiring.
2. They are more concerned about customer satisfaction and expectations.
3. They are masters at collaboration (good teamplayers) and know how to use the expertise of others.
4. There are probably a whole lot more.

The question then is, why aren't there as many female entrepreneurs. I want to think this is more of a societal case than it is, natural.
