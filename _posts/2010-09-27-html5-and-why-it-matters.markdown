HTML5 is a promising technology not only on the desktop but also on mobile devices. What I don't seem to understand is why Adobe seems to be attacking it and trying to prove the superiority of the Flash platform. Adobe has done a wonderful job with Flash but let's face it, another plugin? Hell no.

I don't care that much the outcome of the fight over the desktop browser what I'm really interested in is HTML5 on the mobile browser. So far webkit rules on the mobile - Mobile Safari, Android and pretty much every native browser on Symbian devices. Symbian is yet to have a HTML5 compatible browser even though their browsers are webkit-based, the best we can hope for at this moment is a good browser based on qt-webkit (which is HTML5 ready).

Why does HTML5 matter on the mobile device? Offline Apps, Location, SVG and Canvas for me are probably reasons why HTML5 will be a winner on mobile devices. With HTML5, we'll see a convergence between native apps and the mobile web and _maybe_  we'll finally put an end to the unending argument about which is better.
