I remember the first time I used [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/). I was thrilled with the ability to find places and locate them on a digital map. That was my first exposure to [Geographic Information Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS). But I quickly grew out of it after a while and what was majorly because of the lack of localized information.

I dabbled into Google Maps mashups and built my first Google Maps application when I was working on my final year project in the University but then I saw little use for it locally.

A few months back, Google announced a community-based mapping project known as [Google Map Maker](http://www.google.com/mapmaker). Google Map Maker enables the people who live in areas that have not been well covered by Google to map their localities using the tools that Google has provided. The implication of this is that you now have the ability to map your village, if you wanted to.

### What's the motivation?


That's a rather interesting question because I never really gave thought to it when I started creating maps using Google Map Maker but in giving thought to it, I realized that in providing local content on the Internet not only does it makes the Internet richer but it also provides value for the locals. I earlier mentioned how the Mapping service was of little use to me because there wasn't local data but now, with other people mapping different areas within the country, I am able to determine routes before setting out (for instance).

I remember a particular day I was to meet up with someone somewhere in Lagos Mainland. He described the point of meeting as around the intersection of Opebi Link Road. I wasn't sure of the location but then I thought "worst case scenario, I'll ask someone about it." I decided to put Google Map Maker to the test. I did a search for Opebi Link Road and voila, it showed me the location and I was able to know where it was and how to get there.

Imagine then that you are looking for the nearest branch of a particular bank. Apart from having to consult the list of branches from the bank's web site, you can look it up on Google Map Maker. Now eventually, the information will be integrated into Google Maps proper but for now, everything is still available on Google Map Maker.

So what happens if the information you are looking for is not available? Add it! There's no reason why your company's branches or building (or other features like street names, restaurants, churches, mosques, entertainment venues, etc) is not tagged on the map. Information is being added to the map on a daily basis and your contributions are not only helping give your company visibility, but it's also adding value to others who might find that information useful when the need arises.
