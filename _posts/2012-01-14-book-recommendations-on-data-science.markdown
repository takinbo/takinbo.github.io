In my [predictions for this year](http://blog.timakinbo.com/2012/01/02/top-10-technology-predictions-for-2012/), I said that data science was going to be big. I case you're a new entrant in this field, here are a few book recommendations and they're also free (for now) if you have a Kindle. If you're in Nigeria and you are wondering how to get a Kindle, here's [my guide](http://blog.timakinbo.com/2011/12/31/heres-how-to-get-your-kindle-fire-from-nigeria/) on how to do this.



	
  * [The Evolution of Data Products](http://www.amazon.com/Evolution-Data-Products-ebook/dp/B005QEKQUY/ref=zg_bs_156116011_29)

	
  * [Big Data Now:Â Current Perspectives from O'Reilly Radar](http://www.amazon.com/Big-Data-Now-Perspectives-ebook/dp/B005KDPILI/ref=pd_sim_kinc_1?ie=UTF8&m=AG56TWVU5XWC2)

	
  * [Building Data Science Teams](http://www.amazon.com/Building-Data-Science-Teams-ebook/dp/B005O4U3ZE/ref=zg_bs_156116011_27)


Enjoy.
