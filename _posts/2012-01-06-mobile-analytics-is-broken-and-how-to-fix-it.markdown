I've been seeing this all too often on our geographic places crowd-sourcing app [CrowdPOInt](http://crowdpoint.com.ng). I check Google Analytics and I can't find traffic generated by my own mobile device and after much enquiry I realise that mobile web analytics (just like desktop web analytics) also relies on the browser being able to load a one pixel (or transparent) image being served by the analytics engine. If the browser doesn't load this image, then that hit isn't tracked.




This is a big problem for mobile browsers that have loading of images turned off. The best solution for now is to have your mobile applications directly intervene by triggering the tracking on behalf of the mobile browser.




A better solution would involve requiring the mobile browser to load some other asset like blank css stylesheets or javascript files and performing the tracking on such hits.
