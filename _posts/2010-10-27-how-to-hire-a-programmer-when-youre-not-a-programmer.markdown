I read [this](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2628-how-to-hire-a-programmer-when-youre-not-a-programmer) at the Signal vs Noise blog today and I thought it was worth reblogging with some of my own comments.

Everything Matt mentioned in the post couldn't be "truer" even in a Nigerian context. I remember back in college when some of my colleagues (who are by the way very good developers) would argue about programming languages. You'll hear them argue about PHP being better than Java or even Flash or the other way around and you could tell how passionate they are about the tools and languages they use. In my observation, some of the best programmers I've met are heavily opinionated about programming languages and this is as a result of how much of that language they know and of course this only comes as a result of a lot of use.

Contributing to open source projects is still a new concept with a lot of Nigerian developers and one of the ways to identify exceptional programmers are by their contributions to open source projects. Of all the points Matt wrote, this is one I really want to see a lot of Nigerian developers doing.

I've been working as a freelancer with a client who has been in the IT industry for eons for about a year and one of the things they tell me about good developers is that they know how to communicate. Devs tend to speak geekspeak a lot and for business-types, this makes little or no sense. Your ability to communicate highly complex matters in simple-to-understand language will earn you great points. When next you've been told to explain a highly technical feature in your software project, throw away all the jargon and when you're done writing, ask yourself if your grandmother will understand what you've written. If she will, then you've done a great job. If not, then rewrite it.
