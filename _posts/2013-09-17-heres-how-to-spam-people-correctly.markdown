I've noticed a particular trend with a lot of startup companies in Nigeria - they start out by buying or obtaining an email list and then subscribe them automatically to their blasted email lists - all that talk about growth hacking and shit. Not that I'm faulting trying to obtain an email list but here's one approach that I reckon is more polite. Start by asking for permission to be included in your mailing list and respect people's decision not to subscribe. Here's one example of how an email like that could look.


> Hey there,
>
> Men often have a difficult time dress properly for all sorts of occasions; "What colour of tie do I wear to that function." "What pair of socks go with these pants." You get the idea. My mission is to help them by providing information about what to wear and for what occasion, how to combine pieces of clothing so they match and are pleasing and other fashion-related tips.

> Because I got your email from a paid email list, I'm going to ask that you take an additional step to sign up for my newsletter. Don't worry if you're not interested, you will not hear from me again (I respect you that much). If on the other hand, you're not interested because you do not relate, why not do your clueless male (and female) friends a favour by sharing this email with them?
>
> Thanks for your time and have a lovely day.

Now how's that for an introductory email?
