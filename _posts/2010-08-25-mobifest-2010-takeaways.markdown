It was great to meet with people who were in the mobile devices/mobile applications industry and even though I may not be able to blog about the presentations that took place, I will be providing links to blogs that covered the event.

[Yomi Adegboye](http://www.yomiadegboye.com/) of [Mobility Nigeria](http://mobilitynigeria.com/) has [blogged about the event](http://mobilitynigeria.com/2010/08/17/mobifest-2010-in-pictures/) with a focus more about the devices that were on display or showcased during the event. He talks about the Encipher Android-based tablet as well as the Samsung i9000.

Sheriff Shittu also [blogged](http://webtrendsng.com//blog/highlights-and-pictures-of-mobifest-2010-event/) a bit about it and also provided a link to a larger collection of pictures taken during the event. Unfortunately, the conversations on Twitter are not searchable at the moment and my attempts to find an archive have not yielded any results.

I was on the mobile innovations panel and I gave a short presentation on "Mobile - Is there really an opportunity?" and it's [available online](http://www.slideshare.net/takinbo/mobile-is-there-really-an-opportunity).
