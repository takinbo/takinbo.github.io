For a while now, Amazon S3 has been allowing users to serve static content off the service. What that means is that if your website didn't require any programming or a need to serve dynamic content, you could have your website hosted on Amazon S3.

I was wondering what this meant for existing web hosting companies. I did some math and realised that the most expensive option on Amazon S3 will come down to about â‚¦326.40 per annum for 1GB of storage. I do not know of any web hosting providers with an offering that is not northwards of at least 400% of this amount. I know a lot goes into web hosting: system administration, technical support, customer support... But then 400%? I think there's a bit of a chance of some kind of disruption in this space especially for the market of customers who don't really need a dynamic website.

What are your thoughts?
