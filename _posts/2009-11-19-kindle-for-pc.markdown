[![Kindle for PC](http://blog.timakinbo.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/kindle-pc-email-banner-com-590x.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/pc/download/ref=amb_link_85354831_1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_r=1QGMBFBP4BCYHH5Y7APY&pf_rd_t=1401&pf_rd_p=494702651&pf_rd_i=1000426311)

This is hot! Just got an email from Amazon announcing the availability of a free download of the [Kindle for PC](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=pe_15240_13665050_fe_img_1/?ie=UTF8&docId=1000426311). Ok like I just explained to a colleague, the Kindle is a device from Amazon that allows you to carry around and read ebooks that you download from the Amazon store.

The Kindle for PC on the other hand, is a software application you download from Amazon that enables you to read the same ebooks as you would on the Kindle device, on your PC.

Why the excitement? Well for one, the Kindle was one of the things I had on my wishlist for the Christmas. Even though I still intend to get the device (or some other ebook reader), this is like a wish granted. May be after all, a netbook will not be a bad idea.

This is coming at a time when the Kindle is facing stiff competition from other new entrants. If you asked me, I think this strategy of creating a standalone PC application makes a lot of sense - at least to me.
