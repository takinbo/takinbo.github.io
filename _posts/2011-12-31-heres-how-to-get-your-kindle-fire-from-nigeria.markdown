I got a Kindle Fire a few weeks back and [@pystar](http://twitter.com/pystar) asked me how I did it. This post is a step by step process on how to go about getting one.




The most important part of the process is getting an Amazon.com account. The next step is adding your debit/credit card to your account. This card will be billed for your purchases on the site. I've only gotten a dollar denominated debit card to work on the site so it's not likely that your naira-denominated debit card will work (my trials with the GTB Naira MasterCard are yet to work). Another important point to note is that your billing address will be the address you used while opening your bank account).




Once you've completed the steps above, you can purchase your kindle from the Amazon.com website. The only wrinkle is that Amazon.com will only ship kindles within the US. This is where a freight forwarding company comes in. I use Impex Worldwide for my freight forwarding needs. Essentially, they would give you a shipping address within the US. Anything shipped in your name to this address will be forwarded to their warehouse in Nigeria. Impexworldwide will send you a text message when your shipment arrives and provide instructions on how to pay and collect your shipment. You should visit their [website](http://www.track.impexworldwide.com/) for instructions on [how to use their service](http://www.track.impexworldwide.com/faq.html).




You don't have to even contact Impex before placing your order. Simply make your order and instruct Amazon.com to ship to your customized address, which will be similar to:




Tim Akinbo LAG,  

Impexworldwide Inc. [My Phone No.],  

4000 Bordentown Ave Unit 26,  

Sayreville, NJ 08872




Phone: +1-732-698-9008 




Once your order is completed, Amazon will charge your card and ship your kindle to Impex. Once it arrives Nigeria, they'll inform you and you can then go and claim your shipment.
