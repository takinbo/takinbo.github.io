I was fortunate to be at the Nigerian Internet Entrepreneurs Meetup yesterday that took place at Four Points by Sheraton in Lekki, Lagos. Yeah I say I was fortunate because of all the meetups and other tech events I've attended this year, IMO this is the best of them all.

Thanks to [@OoTheNigerian](http://twitter.com/OoTheNigerian) for putting this together. In attendance at the meetup was [@gbengasesan](http://twitter.com/gbengasesan), [@Possicon](http://twitter.com/Possicon), [@the_dej](http://twitter.com/the_dej), [@emekaokoye](http://twitter.com/emekaokoye), [@startupsnigeria](http://twitter.com/startupsnigeria) and a host of many others too many to mention.

The networking was really great and I'm beginning to see a change in attitude by Nigerian Internet entrepreneurs to collaborate and work together. One of the key highlights was about creating a thriving community of Internet entrepreneurs and this was championed by [@OoTheNigerian](http://twitter.com/OoTheNigerian). [@luminus](http://twitter.com/luminus) shared on the need to make a shit-load of noise about what we're doing highlighting the need for promotion of what it is we do.

[@emekaokoye](http://twitter.com/emekaokoye) shared on his experience with his first Internet startup - [ngex.com](http://www.ngex.com) which he co-founded as far back as 1997. He shared his experience in trying to raise capital for the company, his pitfalls and successes. He ranted about how passion is the most important thing for any developer and how developers in Nigeria lack it. This is not something that only Emeka has experienced. It seems to be the same song everyone who has worked with Nigerian developers for a while sings. Sim Shagaya who was also present at the event narrated a sad experience with Nigerian developers and how he had to hire developers outside the country for his startups. Sim runs a number of startups including [gbogbo.com](http://www.gbogbo.com) and [Lovebase](http://www.lovebase.com). Emeka went on to narrate how startups need to be relevant to be impactful.

There was also this guy from a vc company based in the UK but was interested in investments in Africa. He mentioned that though it might be a little early to be talking about vc funding, it was important that entrepreneurs think about the longterm possibility of vc partnerships and so run their startups to be vc-attractive.

Sim Shagaya went on to talk about how startup communities had been developed around the world and re-iterated the need to build a thriving startup community. He also shared about one of this startups - [Lovebase](http://www.lovebase.com) and how they were using a new Interswitch Nigeria product named Quick teller that made it possible for people to make payments online using the atms.

['Gbenga Sesan](http://twitter.com/gbengasesan) also got to talk about certain policies that have been in place for a while that Internet entrepreneurs could leverage on for financing of their proven projects amogst others.

An attendee raised the issue of continuity and concrete actionable steps that could be taken to build the community and it was agreed that we should have more of these meetings and a mailing list be created to encourage further discussions on topics that affect us or have been raised.

All in all, I'm really glad I made the meetup.
