[![Google Buzz](/public/uploads/2010/02/google_buzz_logo.png)](/public/uploads/2010/02/google_buzz_logo.png)

Well I'll say a lot and only time will really tell and if you're wondering what I'm talking about, it's the recently launched Google Buzz.

Google Buzz is an application that allows you to share web links, photos, videos etc with people who are important to you but that's only half the story. Google Buzz for Mobile is a location based service that allows users of the application to share messages and pictures that are location-aware.

In my attempt to explain it to my girlfriend, I used this example. Assume I walk into an eatery and I discover that they're giving a free donut for every purchase above â‚¦500. I can quickly create a buzz to spread the word. Now because I'm using my phone which has a built-in GPS, it records my location and every other person who sees the buzz can identify the location.

There are countless other use cases. Imagine a community service that allows community members to report accidents using Google Buzz for Mobile. Others might include, crime reporting, reporting lost items, reviews and so on.

I've been playing around with it and I'm hoping to see more people come on board to give it a try. If you do not have an Iphone or Android 2.0 compatible phone, your best bet would be to attempt to install Google Maps for Mobile 4.0 by visiting [http://mobile.google.com/](http://mobile.google.com/) on your mobile phone and clicking on Google Maps. If your phone is supported and you can install Google Maps for Mobile version 4.0, then you can enable the **Buzz** layer and start buzzing.
