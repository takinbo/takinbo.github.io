![Sublime Text message dialog](/public/uploads/2014/05/sublimetext_dialog.png)

I'm one of those people who would rather do everything with a keyboard than 
have to switch from using the keyboard to the mouse even momentarily, and the 
reason? It's just a plain waste of time. Everytime you have to switch from 
using the keyboard to using the mouse, you context switch and this can cost 
you valueable time and attention. Unfortunately, user interface elements like 
message dialogs are here to stay and they are useful.

How do you interact with a message dialog like the one pictured above with 
the keyboard? Until now, I had to cycle through the buttons by repeatedly 
pressing the <kbd>⇥</kbd> (TAB) key until the button I wanted to activate was 
highlighted.

I found a [post](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7263/how-can-i-select-buttons-with-just-the-keyboard) 
that documents other, albeit better approaches.

Essentially,

* Pressing <kbd>space</kbd> (SPACE) selects the **active** button (blue outline)
* Pressing <kbd>esc</kbd> (ESC) will choose the **cancel** button
* Pressing <kbd>↩</kbd> (RETURN) selects the **default** button (blue, pulsing, filled)
* On some other dialogs, pressing <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>firstletter</kbd> will select 
  the button whose text starts with **firstletter**
