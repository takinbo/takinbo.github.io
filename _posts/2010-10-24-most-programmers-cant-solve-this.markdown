Pascal Ehigie Aito wrote an interesting [blog post](http://aitoehigie.wordpress.com/2010/10/24/most-programmers-cant-solve-this/) this morning and I'll suggest visiting his blog to read about the challenge.

For those of you who do take the challenge to write a solution, please leave a comment with a link to your solution. Any programming language is accepted.

Here is a tip: You really need to understand what "divisibility" means in a mathematical context. Hint: it has something to do with modulus. That said, the reason why a programmer wouldn't be able to solve this problem will have to do with not understanding computation in general.

I'll be posting and explaining my solution in a few days so watch out for it.
